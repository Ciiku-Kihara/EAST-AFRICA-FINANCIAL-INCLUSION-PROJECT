# EAST-AFRICA-FINANCIAL-INCLUSION-PROJECT
This project was aimed at explaining the main factors that determine whether or not an individual in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Uganda own a bank account and to what degree.

## Names of Contributors
Faith Kihara

## Description
This repository contains a Google Collaboratory notebook that contains Python code that I used to analyze a financial dataset
that contains demographic and financial information on Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda from 2016 to 2018. I used the Exploratory Data Analysis
Approach to conduct univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis. I was expected to implement the solution by performing the respective analysis i.e. 
factor analysis, principal component analysis, and discriminant analysis.

## Setup Instructions
To make changes to my code, you can go ahead and fork my work.
